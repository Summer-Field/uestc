Now when mention the term boom and bust what does that bring to mind?

the dot-crash in 90s

ok the boom in the late 1990 when all the all internet companies springed up and then sold for a huge of money

then the bust arout 2001 when many of those same internet companies went out of business

of course the boom are followed by busts we've certainly seen times when the local economy expanded rapidly for a while  and went back to normal pace of growth

but there is a type of rapid expasion well maybe a hysterical or irrational boom that pretty much always leads to a  bust

see people often create and intensify a boom when it get carried away by some new industry that seem like it will make a lot of money fast

youdthink by the 20s people would have learn from the past, if thet did well look at the 

tuplis you mean like flowers?

exactly for instance do you have any idea  where tulips are from?originally i mean

well the nether land right?

that's what most think but no they are not native to the nertherland or even europe

tuplis acctually have from the area the chinese call the celescail mountain a very remote moutainous region

It was turcakye nomads who first dicovered tulips  and spread them slowly westforward

now around the 19 century eroupean were travel arount estanbuer and turkeys as merchants deeply diplomats

and the turks often give the eroupeans tulips as gitf which thet carry home with them

for eroupean the tulips are totally unheard of a great novelty

the bolbs show up the nertherlant the merchant thought that thet grow them
